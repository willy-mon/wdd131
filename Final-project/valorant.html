    <h2>WHAT IS VALORANT</h2>
    <p id="intro">
        Created in June 2, 2022 by Riot Games, Valorant is a First Person Shooter
        with Hero shooter style, meaning that you can shoot or use diferent abilities
        from each character to win. Since the creation, Valorant has grown a lot
        expanding his community and they E-sport scene, having 15.33 million players
        when I'm writing this, and with a peak of 1.3 million simultaneous spectators 
        in a tournament final. 
    </p>
    <h2>HOW TO WIN</h2>
    <p>
        In Valorant you win when your team make 13 points, you get points winning rounds
        each team have five players and with the name of "attackers" and "defenders", 
        Each round lasts at least 2 minutes, if the attackers don't plant the Spike or
        kill all defenders, the defenders win a round you have two more ways to win 
        rounds, the first one and more easy, kill all your enemies.
        Or you can go with more strategy and plant the Spike as an attacker or defusing
        it if you are a defender, but what is the Spike?
        
    </p>
    <h2>THE SPIKE</h2>
    <p>
        
        The Spike is a bomb that the attackers need to plant in an already defined 
        part of the map, when its planted the Spike would explode after 45 seconds giving
        the victory of the round to the attackers, but be carefull when the Spike is 
        planted the defenders can go and defuse it, giving the victory of the round to
        the defenders.
    </p>
    <h2>GAME PLAN</h2>
    <p>
        As an attacker once you plant the bomb your plan is to kill all the defenders
        before they defuse it, or you can use strategy to stop them to go to the bomb
        and win the round with the explotion of the spike. As a defender when the 
        attacker plant the Spike you need to think how to defuse the Spike before it
        explodes.
