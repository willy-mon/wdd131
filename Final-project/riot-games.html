                <article>
                    <p>Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher, and esports tournament organizer 
                        based in Los Angeles. It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop 
                        League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person 
                        shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Its publishing arm, 
                        Riot Forge, oversaw the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers until its shutdown in 
                        January 2024. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the 
                        League of Legends universe (One of my favorites series).
                        Riot Games operates League of Legends esports leagues and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, 
                        which had 20 offices worldwide as of 2023, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights 
                        for its leagues.</p>

            <h1 class="riot-titles">league Of Legends</h1>
            <article>
                <p>League of Legends (LoL), is a 2009 
                    multiplayer online battle arena video game. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map 
                    for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone 
                    game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League 
                    has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable 
                    character customization. The game is available for Microsoft 
                    Windows and macOS.
                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team 
                    occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a 
                    character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                    During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, 
                    earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's 
                    main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base 
                    and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game 
                    . A free-to-play game, 
                    Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing 
                    several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy 
                    while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the 
                    codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for 
                    Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 
                    June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is an auto battler game. The game is a spinoff 
                    of League of Legends and is based 
                    on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other 
                    opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. The game 
                    released as a League of Legends game mode for Windows and macOS in 
                    June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, 
                    featuring cross-platform play between them.
                    The battlefield consists of hexagons, where players can strategically 
                    place units on the hexagons on their side of the game board between rounds. 
                    During each round, a short battle automatically commences, with two players 
                    matched randomly for that round, or else paired against computer-controlled 
                    enemies, frequently called PVE rounds. In the rounds against 
                    computer-controlled enemies, each enemy has a chance to drop gold, units, 
                    or items that the player can use.</p>

                <p>Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story is a 2023 platform video 
                    game developed by Tequila Works and published by Riot Forge.
                    Players control Nunu, a character from League of Legends, as he 
                    searches for a magical item called the Heart of the Blue. Song of 
                    Nunu is a platformer in which players must jump over hazards, 
                    solve puzzles, and engage in snowball fights. There are some 
                    areas where stealth or combat is necessary. Nunu is accompanied 
                    by Willump, a yeti, who assists him.</p>
